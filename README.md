# MARS-Orbit
This is a code to estimate a "circular" trajectory of Mars using a subset Tycho Brahe's observations of Mars's positions. Herein, first I have formulated the objective function based on the maximum Oppositions Longitude Discrepancy("maxError"), and use libraries and techniques to find the optimum parameters so as to minimize the "maxError" upto below four minutes.
